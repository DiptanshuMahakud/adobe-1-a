From time to time, ISTQB will update this document to reflect any additional extensions that shall be introduced for the Foundation Level, or to reflect major changes in existing ones. Publications of the updated document will be available on the ISTQB website. The ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for some time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often are brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the Expert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the ISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and introduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but that is beyond the scope of this document. The following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released:  Agile Tester In this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business Outcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who achieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and will outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this level.

For the last two years the Ontario Library Association has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario’s 5000+ public libraries, university, college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries. Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these skills and resources at work or at home. We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society. The concept of an ODL is a key element in",

The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to “connect students to new workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities”. The ODL will do that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life. Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living rooms. Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems, and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems. Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences. For example, The Alberta Library (TAL)",

TAL works collaboratively with its members to promote universal access to materials and resources in more than 250 public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries. Unlike ODL, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL‘s experience. TAL’s business planning took several years. TAL’s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is Alberta’s population 30% of Ontario’s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries. ODL envisions universal access for all 10,000,000 Ontarians, with more than 5000 Ontario libraries as partners. Although ODL can learn from TAL’s practices, the scope of planning and implementing ODL is much larger than TAL. The ODL will be a partnership-based organization providing seamless electronic information services and resources to the citizens of Ontario. It will use local libraries as the entry point for common resources The ODL will recognize the unique responsibilities and needs of public libraries, school libraries, college and university libraries and special libraries.

This plan will clearly define the ODL’s services, funding and governance structures, as well as implementation plans for 2003-2005. It will also secure the full commitment of all stakeholders and scope the operational plan for ODL for 2006 and beyond. Given the number and diversity of stakeholders involved, the business planning process must be a fully consultative approach. To ensure that the planning results in a workable plan with the full commitment of all stakeholders it must have competent, dedicated staffing and monies for the travel and communication components so critical in a consultative process.

The ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants (i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants (university, colleges, public libraries and schools). The proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as the ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions: 1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period 2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period 3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55% during the same period OVERVIEW OF ODL FUNDING MODEL",
