# PDF Title and Section Classifier

## üß† Approach

Our solution combines PDF layout parsing with a fine-tuned NLP model to classify document elements such as titles, section headers (H1, H2, H3), and other non-structural text.

1. **Layout Extraction**:  
   We use `PyMuPDF` (also known as `fitz`) to extract text content along with their positional layout information from the input PDFs.

2. **Text Classification**:  
   A fine-tuned transformer model `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` is used to classify each line of text into one of three categories:
   - Title
   - Section header (H1, H2, H3)
   - Negative (non-title/non-section text)

3. **Post-Processing Heuristics**:  
   After classification, rule-based heuristics refine the results by analyzing font size, indentation, and structural patterns to distinguish between H1, H2, and H3.
